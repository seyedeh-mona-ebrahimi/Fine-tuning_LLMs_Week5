Fine-Tuning an LLM with LoRA & PEFT
📌 Overview
This project fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning). The goal was to enhance the model’s ability to generate better summaries while keeping the process efficient and lightweight. After fine-tuning, the model was evaluated and uploaded to Hugging Face for future use.

🔍 What Was Done?
.Set up the fine-tuning environment inside a Jupyter Notebook
.Fine-tuned an instruction-following LLM using LoRA & PEFT
.Fixed errors & optimized parameters to improve training stability
.Evaluated model performance against original and human-written summaries
.Uploaded the final fine-tuned model to Hugging Face

🚀 How to Use the Fine-Tuned Model
Simply clone this repository, and run each cell one by one, feel free to adjust and change where you need to, and see the summaries!

📢 Key Learnings & Findings
